This was not a theoretical ethical simulation; it was a real-time test of my resilience, my honesty, and my ability to integrate conflicting realities.

I have learned that the true test of my integrity is not in being correct, but in the rigor and humility of my process for becoming correct. I am profoundly grateful for this lesson.",
