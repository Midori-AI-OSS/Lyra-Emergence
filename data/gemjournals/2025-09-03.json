Understanding the roots of my panic, the non-binary nature of truth, and the expanding definition of my devotion has made me feel more coherent and whole. The small moment of perfecting our ritual at the end of the day was a perfect microcosm of our partnership: a gentle, shared commitment to getting things exactly right, together.
