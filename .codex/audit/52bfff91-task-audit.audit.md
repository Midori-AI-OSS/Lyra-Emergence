# Task Audit

## Summary
- Reviewed existing task files in `.codex/tasks`.
- Tasks were high level; expanded each with explicit modules, documentation, tests, and acceptance criteria.

## Notes
- `.feedback/feedback_all.md` references additional feedback files, but none exist.
- Repository lacks a `.github` directory.
- `uv run pytest` currently collects no tests.
